# ML From Scratch

Hands-on implementations of classic ML algorithms using math and numpy for studying.

## Overview

This repository contains educational implementations of machine learning algorithms built from first principles. Each algorithm is implemented using only numpy and basic mathematical operations to provide clear understanding of the underlying mechanics.

## Implemented Algorithms

### Linear Regression

- **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**: Classic closed-form solution / statistical approach
- **Gradient Descent Implementation**

## Learning Approach

Each implementation focuses on:

- Mathematical clarity over performance optimization (otherwise just use scikit-learn lol)
- Step-by-step derivations in accompanying notebooks
- Minimal dependencies to understand core concepts
